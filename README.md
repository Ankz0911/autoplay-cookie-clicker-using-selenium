# autoplay-cookie-clicker-using-selenium

Game introduction - there's a cookie in the centre and a counter on the left side, every time you click the cookie there's an increment in the counter.
on the right hand side , there's a store that provides multiple items such as cursor, that automatically clicks on the cookie every 5 seconds. As utility increases, the cost of the product increases.

this project uses selenium and pycharm , and time module to keep a track on the time elapsed .
in the code, it runs for a total of 5 mins, and after every 5 seconds, it checks the available items by comparing the cost with the counter, and automatically purchases the product with the highest cost.
to run it , you can either paste the code into pycharm and alter the code to chromedriver.exe as per your system.
